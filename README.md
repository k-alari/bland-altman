# bland-altman

This R Shiny applet walks the user through a Bayesian approach to Bland Altman analysis. This applet was designed to be a companion to the following publication: https://doi.org/10.1080/1091367X.2020.1853130 

This applet gives several different prior options (vague, normal-gamma, or uniform) and users can supply hyperparameter values directly or follow the induced prior specification guide provided in the companion paper. 

The applet is live at [https://kalari.shinyapps.io/BBAA/](https://kalari.shinyapps.io/BBAA/)
